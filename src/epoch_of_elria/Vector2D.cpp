#include "Vector2D.h"

// Vector2D implementation is mostly inline in the header file
// This file exists to satisfy the build system and can contain
// any additional Vector2D methods if needed in the future

// Currently all Vector2D methods are implemented inline in Vector2D.h
// for performance reasons since they are simple mathematical operations
