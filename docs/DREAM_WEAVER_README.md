## 🎵 Lore and Setting

The Metaverse is an infinite realm where consciousness shapes reality through narrative intent. The One, seeking absolute order, suppresses unwritten stories and individual expression. Four heroes emerge with the power to transform rather than destroy:

- **The Infinite Library** (Xing's domain) - Repository of all possible stories
- **Sterile Reality** (Xerx's prison) - Oppressive realm of enforced conformity  
- **The Heart's Journey** - From dying book to active participant
- **Lyra's Melody** - Pure harmony awakening consciousness everywhere

Victory comes not through violence, but through showing The One that order and creativity can dance together in eternal harmony.
